# RPGCharacterCreator

This is a Character creator project that I have been working on while learning NodeJS and Express. The project allows a user to register an account, login, create a new PRGCharacter
(Currently only DnD-5e is availible), and save the character to the user account. The character is viewable only to the author by defualt, and is editable. 
A PDF can be generated for printing.

Currently a good amount of work is needed, but I am to a state where I'm willing to show it off some.
